Human physiology and behavior are deeply rooted in the daily 24 hour
temporal structure. Our biological processes vary significantly, predictably,
and idiosyncratically throughout the day in accordance with these circadian
rhythms, which in turn influence our physical and mental performance.
Persistent disruptions to our innate biological rhythms can have serious
consequences for physical and mental well-being — contributing to
cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, and mental health problems. However,
in our modern mobile world, with its “always-on” ethos, circadian disruptions
are becoming increasingly wide-spread.

In this work, we focus on advancing a vision of “_Circadian Computing_”
— technologies that support and adapt to our innate biological rhythms. In
particular, we focus on designing, developing and deploying technologies that
can unobtrusively assess our body clock profiles, identify circadian
disruptions and provide in-situ interventions to maintain stability. Such
technologies can provide key support across a wide range of domains including
physical and cognitive performance, sleep, clinical therapy, and overall
well-being.

Nearly 60 million adults in the United States suffer from mental health issues
each year. However, less than 33% of them receive adequate mental health
treatment. This is partially due to the lack of trained mental health workers.
Over the next several decades, the shortage of mental health workers is
expected to reach the hundreds of thousands. It is essential to create
scalable approaches for training future mental health workforce.

In this project, we are focusing on human-AI collaboration for scalable
training of mental health workers. Our goal is to facilitate ethical and
effective teaming with AI that promotes learning and skill development for
future mental health workforce.

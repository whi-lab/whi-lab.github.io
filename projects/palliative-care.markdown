Individuals with advanced cancer are living longer given the recent improvement
in treatment. As a result, there is an increased need for longitudinal support
for symptom management for this population. However, there is a shortage of
palliative care specialists, particularly in rural areas.

This project aims to create a conversational agent to support individuals living
with advanced cancer. We are using generative AI under the supervision of
clinical experts to provide interventions focusing on personalized
self-management support in palliative care.

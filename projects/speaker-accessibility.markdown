Given the rise in popularity of smart assistants and smart home voice-controlled devices, more diverse user groups are adopting such technologies for everyday purposes.  Previous work has highlighted the promise these devices can offer for users with low vision or mobility concerns to increase their independence in everyday tasks.  However, the opportunities and challenges faced by deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) users have yet to be addressed, despite evidence that shows a growing interest in these technologies, especially in older adult populations and hearing aid users.  Our aim is to develop design recommendations to better address the challenges faced by DHH users, without compromising the "embedded-in-life" experience users seek from voice interaction SAs. Additionally, we are interested in exploring additional applications for SAs within this context, such as speech therapy, that may benefit other users and further justify the need for increased accessibility in SA devices.

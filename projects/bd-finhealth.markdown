There is a strong association between [bipolar disorder and financial instability](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09638237.2018.1521920).
For example, manic episodes in bipolar disorder can lead to compulsive buying
and risk-taking behaviors.

This project focuses on developing user-centric, privacy-preserving financial
technologies (FinTech) that leverage open banking data to:
i) identify problematic financial behaviors; and ii) provide personalized
interventions to reduce risk of harm for individuals with mental illnesses.

Our overall goal is to reshape the design and development of financial
technologies that work for all.  The outcomes can also inform policies toward
accessible financial tools that can be integrated into mental healthcare.

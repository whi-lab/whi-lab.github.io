Dementia is a global public health concern. There are currently more than 55
million persons living with dementia (PLwDs) globally. Dementia is strongly
associated with the deteriorating ability to manage personal finances. PLwDs
might be unable to perform routine financial tasks (e.g., paying bills), may
make poor decisions, and be susceptible to financial fraud and scams. As a
result, care partners are often forced to undertake financial management
tasks for PLwDs in addition to other care responsibilities. However, it can be
particularly challenging for care partners as they might not have the necessary
training and skills for financial management and decision-making. Furthermore,
collaborative financial management can be difficult.

This project focuses on supporting collaborative financial management involving
different stakeholders while preserving the agency of PLwDs. We are aiming to
identify financial management needs and challenges for individuals with
dementia and their care partners. Our goal is to design fintech and provide
resources to support collaborative financial management in dementia care.

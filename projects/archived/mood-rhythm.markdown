Rhythms guide our lives. Our biological clocks tell us when we need to sleep,
eat and wake. But our use of technology can interrupt and obstruct these rhythms,
making it difficult for our bodies to get what they need to stay healthy and
balanced. MoodRhythm helps individuals with bipolar disorder to live a more
naturally rhythmic day, ensuring that they can maintain balanced and healthy
lives.

It is based on a clinically validated therapy, Interpersonal Social
Rhythm Therapy, developed by Dr. Ellen Frank at University of Pittsburgh. The
key goals of MoodRhythm are to use patientsâ€™ smartphones to both actively and
passively track daily rhythms and to provide affective feedback that can help
patients to maintain a regular daily rhythm, while feeding this clinically
valuable information back to their physicians.

Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is one of the most effective interventions
for maintaining cognitive functioning and wellbeing of persons living with
dementia (PLwDs). Recent studies have consistently shown that CST improves
cognition, wellbeing, and quality of life (QoL) for PLwDs. However, providing
CST to individuals in need remains a serious challenge.

This project aims to develop a VA to deliver customized and tailored cognitive
stimulation therapy for PLwDs. We will minimize care partner burden and provide
effective support to deliver CST sessions at home. The project will establish
a preliminary evidence base regarding the feasibility and acceptability of
using VAs for dementia interventions. Given the wide adoption of VAs, the project
can positively impact a large population of PLwDs and care partners including
those living in remote and rural areas.

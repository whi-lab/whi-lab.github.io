The recent Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health and wellbeing, leading to large-scale lifestyle change, social isolation, and high stress. This has been especially pertinent to essential workers—from those in the medical field treating patients to those in retail supply chains meeting the needs of everyday life. In this work, we aim to understand some of the key issues related to mental health and wellbeing of essential workers during the Covid-19 pandemic and the role technology and social media can play. 
​To do so, we take a two-pronged approach. By analyzing essential workers’ Twitter posts from a large-scale data set, we map out trends over the course of the pandemic, both for frequency and content, as well as a comparison of mental health discourse before and during the pandemic. Additionally, we conduct interviews with a range of essential workers to study their first-hand experiences and the effects the pandemic has had on their social isolation, stress, and mental wellbeing at a greater depth, as well as their current coping strategies and how they have continued to remotely maintain their social support networks during this time. Based on this insight, we identify challenges for existing technologies and key points where technology can better help support their needs related to mental wellbeing.​

The relationship between mental health and financial difficulties is complex. Those living with mental illnesses are at increased risk of financial hardships and debt-related stress. This can be further complicated by a range of problematic financial behaviors related to specific mental health symptoms, such as impulsive purchasing or missing deadlines. While previous studies have resulted in valuable insights on how mental health symptoms can manifest in specific financial behaviors, they might not lead to the complete picture given their reliance on self-reported perceptions of individual’s own behaviors. In other words, self-reported data can suffer from incomplete recall and other biases, particularly during symptomatic periods. Being able to access objective personal financial data can help to address this issue. Recent increased digitization of banking services have made fine grained personal financial data more accessible than ever before. By leveraging this objective financial data, we can more easily investigate this relationship — the ebb and flow of finances and mental health.

Mental health is a critical public issue globally. Financial stability is essential for successful rehabilitation and quality-of-life for individuals with mental illness. Our project aims to understand and prevent problematic financial behaviors, which can lead to improved mental health outcomes. The project will also contribute to novel data analysis and machine learning frameworks for granular assessment and personalized interventions. We will establish design guidelines to support the financial wellbeing of vulnerable populations and their carepartners.

There is a strong association between mental illness and financial instability. For example, manic episodes in bipolar disorder can lead to compulsive buying and risk-taking behaviors.  We are developing user-centric, privacy-preserving financial technologies (FinTech) that leverage open banking data to: i) identify problematic financial behaviors; and ii) provide personalized interventions to reduce risk of harm for individuals with mental illnesses.

Our project can lead to novel, supportive technologies to empower individuals with mental illness to achieve financial stability and independence. It can also reshape the design and development of financial technologies, contributing to the idea of FinTech for good”. We hope to develop a novel, privacy-preserving, and user-centric computational framework for financial data analysis and personalized interventions. The outcomes can also inform policies toward accessible financial tools that can be integrated into mental healthcare.

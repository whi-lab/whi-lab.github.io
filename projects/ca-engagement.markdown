In recent years, there has been a significant rise in digital health technologies
including smartphone apps. These technologies potentially solve a critical issue
in health care delivery — wide dissemination of evidence-based interventions in
a scalable manner. As such, it is understandable that there is a certain optimism
and enthusiasm about eHealth technologies and their potential ability to reshape
health care.

However, most eHealth technologies suffer from low engagement and adherence
issues. For example, data from the PTSD Coach app — developed by the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) — indicate that only [5.5% patients remained engaged
after a year][ptsd-coach]. Successful interventions for
[better health outcomes often require high engagement and adherence][engagement-impact]
from participants. The failure of
current technologies to sustain longitudinal engagement thus can lead to non-optimal
outcomes and undermine their efficacy. As such, there is an immediate and urgent
need to develop new theoretical frameworks and methodologies to address the
engagement and adherence issues.

I am aiming to address these critical issues by developing conversational
agents (CAs). These domain-specific agents are designed to provide interactive
psychoeducation, assessment tools, and personalized illness management
strategies while maintaining social presence and process accountability to
sustain user engagement.

The development of such CAs will involve solving a number of technical and design
challenges. Specifically, CAs require turn-taking and interactivity, which
results in active information flow in both ways rather than just passive
delivery of information content. This involves i) natural language processing
for understanding user input and broader context; ii) dialogue management;
iii) adaptive interaction design. We also leverage active listening
and [supportive accountability theory][supportive-accountability] to ensure social presence and
sustained user engagement.

The outcomes of this project will not only advance the theory and methods for
designing CAs but also address an urgent need of the broader eHealth community.

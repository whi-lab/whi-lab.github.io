Messaging is a critical component of any health interventions. Successful
interventions require figuring out what to say and how to say it. These messages
must adhere to a set of predefined strategies and theories. Messages must also
be adapted to support personalized needs. It is also critical to ensure novelty
and sustain engagement. Given these requirements, it can be challenging to
generate intervention messages.

In this project, we are exploring how to integrate human supervision and
generative AI to provide theory-driven, personalized, and engaging health
interventions.

Welcome to the Wellbeing & Health Innovation (WHI: pronounced as ‘_why_’) lab!
Our goal is to improve health equity and access _for all_. We develop
human-centered and data-driven technologies to support health and wellbeing at
scale. Our research is inherently interdisciplinary, contributing to both human
computer interaction (HCI) and digital health domains.

We are currently working on [democratizing financial technologies (fintech)]
[fintech-projects] to support marginalized communities. We are creating
collaborative fintech to address unique needs of individuals with
[bipolar disorder][bd-fintech] and [dementia][dementia-fintech]. We are also
working on [novel human-centered AI systems][hcai-projects] to improve health
and wellbeing. We are particularly interested in human-AI collaboration for
[training mental health workers] [teammait], [improving dementia care][dementia-va],
[supporting palliative care][palliative-care], and
[generating personalized health interventions] [genai-intervention].
